Create the App
Go to the directory where you maintain your source code, and create a cordova project:

$ cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld
This creates the required directory structure for your cordova app. By default, the cordova create script generates a skeletal web-based application whose home page is the project's www/index.html file.

Add Platforms
All subsequent commands need to be run within the project's directory, or any subdirectories:

$ cd hello
Add the platforms that you want to target your app. We will add the 'ios' and 'android' platform and ensure they get saved to config.xml and package.json:

$ cordova platform add ios
$ cordova platform add android
To check your current set of platforms:

$ cordova platform ls
Running commands to add or remove platforms affects the contents of the project's platforms directory, where each specified platform appears as a subdirectory.

Note: When using the CLI to build your application, you should not edit any files in the /platforms/ directory. The files in this directory are routinely overwritten when preparing applications for building, or when plugins are re-installed.

Install pre-requisites for building
To build and run apps, you need to install SDKs for each platform you wish to target. Alternatively, if you are using browser for development you can use browser platform which does not require any platform SDKs.

To check if you satisfy requirements for building the platform:

$ cordova requirements
Requirements check results for android:
Java JDK: installed .
Android SDK: installed
Android target: installed android-19,android-21,android-22,android-23,Google Inc.:Google APIs:19,Google Inc.:Google APIs (x86 System Image):19,Google Inc.:Google APIs:23
Gradle: installed

Requirements check results for ios:
Apple OS X: not installed
Cordova tooling for iOS requires Apple OS X
Error: Some of requirements check failed

Build the App
By default, cordova create script generates a skeletal web-based application whose start page is the project's www/index.html file. Any initialization should be specified as part of the deviceready event handler defined in www/js/index.js.

Run the following command to build the project for all platforms:

$ cordova build
You can optionally limit the scope of each build to specific platforms - 'ios' in this case:

$ cordova build ios
